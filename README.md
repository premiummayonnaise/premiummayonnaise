- 👀 I’m interested in analog/AMS IC design and power-management integrated circuits
I work on linear/switching voltage regulators and protection circuits plus IC layouting
- Rail-to-Rail OTA, high-gain OTA, auxiliary OTA, voltage references, current mirrors, etc
- My main approach is gm/id and specifications-driven design while ensuring robustness via stress-testing across PVT
